# Nested Arrays

# Arrays can contain any type of data, including other arrays. An array that contains other arrays is called a nested array, or a multidimensional array.

# Nested arrays can be useful to store groups of similar data or positional data. The following nested array of test scores is storing groups of similar data and the teacher mailboxes is storing groups of positional data.

    [94, 55, 67, 81]
