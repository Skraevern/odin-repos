// // Introduction

// In our JavaScript fundamentals course, you should have learned the basics of using objects to store and retrieve data. Letâ€™s start with a little refresher.

// There are multiple ways to define objects but in most cases, it is best to use the object literal syntax as follows:

const myObject = {
    property: "Value!",
    otherProperty: 77,
    "obnoxious property": function () {
        // do stuff!
    },
};
