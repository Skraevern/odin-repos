The importance of data
As human beings, we are limited in our capacity to remember things. Having tools that allow immediate access and analysis of data enables us to make better decisions.

Today, we have systems that allow a doctor to review the patient's medical record before prescribing a new drug. A bioinformatic scientist can query genome data to find the genetic basis of disease. A baseball scout looking at player statistics can assess the value of a player.

All these decisions can be successfully arrived at by collecting data, organizing it and then studying it to find patterns and meaning. This data has to be stored in a way that lends itself to studying. In other words, we need to structure it.

This is a video by Hans Rosling. By collecting data about 200 countries over 200 years, he provides a perspective on human progress.
