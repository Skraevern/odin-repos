Structured Data
In order to better learn about structured data, it is useful to understand the problem that it aims to solve: the limitations of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that contains information without any structure, such as content inside emails or books or images.

Storing data in an unstructured way might work if you only have a small amount, but once the amount of data starts to grow it soon becomes unwieldy. For example, if you want to find a particular note you made in a notebook, you may need to look through the entire book to find it. At this point you need a way of organising, or structuring, your data. One way to structure data is to store it in tabular format (rows and columns), such as in spreadsheets or todo lists.

Storing data in a structured way, such as in a table or a spreadsheet, allows us to find the data easily and also to manage it better. The data can be arranged and analyzed in various ways such as sorting alphabetically or totalling a set of values.

A common way of storing data in a structured manner is to use a relational database. A basic definition of a database is simply 'a structured set of data held in a computer'.
