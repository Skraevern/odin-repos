Setting Stuff Up
SQL lets you do everything. The first category of commands are for setting up the database (CREATE DATABASE), setting up an individual table (CREATE TABLE), and similar commands for altering or destroying them. The setup information for your database is stored in a special file called the “Schema”, and this is updated whenever you make changes to the structure of your database. Think of the schema as saying “here’s our database and it’s got a couple tables. The first table is ‘users’ and it’s got columns for ‘ID’ (which is an integer), ‘name’ (which is a bunch of characters), ‘email’ (which is a bunch of characters) …”

In addition to setting up tables, you can tell your database to only allow unique values in a particular column (e.g. for usernames) or to index a column for faster searching later with CREATE INDEX. Create indexes, which basically do all the hard work of sorting your table ahead of time, for columns that you’ll likely be using to search on later (like username)… it will make your database much faster.

SQL likes semicolons at the end of lines and using single quotes (‘) instead of double quotes(“).
