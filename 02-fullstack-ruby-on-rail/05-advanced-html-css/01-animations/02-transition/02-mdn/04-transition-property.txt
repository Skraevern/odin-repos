transition-property
The transition-property CSS property sets the CSS properties to which a transition effect should be applied.

Note: The set of properties that can be animated is subject to change. As such, you should avoid including any properties in the list that don't currently animate, as someday they might, causing unexpected results.

If you specify a shorthand property (e.g., background), all of its longhand sub-properties that can be animated will be.
