Introduction
The transform property is a powerful tool to change the appearance of elements without affecting the natural document flow.

You have likely seen it in action on many of your favorite websites! Transforms are very commonly used for animated effects. While we are sure you’ll like to create sleek animations of your own, we first need to understand how transforms work.

Basics of Transforms
The transform property takes in one or more CSS transform functions as its values, with those functions taking in their own value, usually an angle or a number.

Almost all elements can have the transform property applied to it, with the exceptions being <col>, <colgroup>, and non-replaced inline elements. “Non-replaced” simply refers to elements whose content is contained within the HTML document (<span>, <b>, and <em>, for example), as opposed to a “replaced” element’s content being contained outside of the document (<a>, <iframe>, and <img>, for example). You do not need to memorize every element that is non-replaced, but rather keep this knowledge in mind should you try to apply the transform property to an element and aren’t sure why it isn’t working.

Two-Dimensional Transforms
In this section, we’ll go through 2D transforms with the following transform functions: rotate, scale, skew, and translate.
