#This method is nearly the same as #each, but it provides some additional functionality by yielding two block variables instead of one as it iterates through an array. The first variable’s value is the element itself, while the second variable’s value is the index of that element within the array. This allows you to do things that are a bit more complex.


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "strawberry", "pineapple"]

fruits.each_with_index { |fruit, index| puts fruit if index.even? }

#=> apple
#=> strawberry
#=> ["apple", "banana", "strawberry", "pineapple"]
