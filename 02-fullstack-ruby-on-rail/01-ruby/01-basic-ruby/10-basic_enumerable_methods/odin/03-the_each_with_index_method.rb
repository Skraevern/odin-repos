#This method is nearly the same as #each, but it provides some additional functionality by yielding two block variables instead of one as it iterates through an array. The first variableâ€™s value is the element itself, while the second variableâ€™s value is the index of that element within the array. This allows you to do things that are a bit more complex.


fruits = ["apple", "banana", "strawberry", "pineapple"]

fruits.each_with_index { |fruit, index| puts fruit if index.even? }

#=> apple
#=> strawberry
#=> ["apple", "banana", "strawberry", "pineapple"]
