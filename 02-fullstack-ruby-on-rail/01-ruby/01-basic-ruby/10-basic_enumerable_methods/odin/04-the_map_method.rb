#The #map method (also called #collect) transforms each element from an array according to whatever block you pass to it and returns the transformed elements in a new array. #map may seem confusing at first, but it is extremely useful. Weâ€™ll go through several examples and use cases, which should help you understand how and when you can use this enumerable power for good.


friends = ['Sharon', 'Leo', 'Leila', 'Brian', 'Arun']

friends.map { |friend| friend.upcase }
#=> `['SHARON', 'LEO', 'LEILA', 'BRIAN', 'ARUN']



my_order = ['medium Big Mac', 'medium fries', 'medium milkshake']

my_order.map { |item| item.gsub('medium', 'extra large') }
#=> ["extra large Big Mac", "extra large fries", "extra large milkshake"]



salaries = [1200, 1500, 1100, 1800]

salaries.map { |salary| salary - 700 }
#=> [500, 800, 400, 1100]
