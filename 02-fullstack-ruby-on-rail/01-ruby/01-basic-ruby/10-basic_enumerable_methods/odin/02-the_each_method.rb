#each is the granddaddy of the enumerable methods. It’s a bit like Chuck Norris: it can do anything. As you’ll see throughout this lesson, though, just because you can use #each to do just about anything doesn’t mean it’s always the best or most efficient tool for the job.

#Calling #each on an array will iterate through that array and will yield each element to a code block, where a task can be performed:


friends = ['Sharon', 'Leo', 'Leila', 'Brian', 'Arun']

friends.each { |friend| puts "Hello, " + friend }

#=> Hello, Sharon
#=> Hello, Leo
#=> Hello, Leila
#=> Hello, Brian
#=> Hello, Arun

#=> ["Sharon", "Leo", "Leila", "Brian" "Arun"]


my_array = [1, 2]

my_array.each do |num|
  num *= 2
  puts "The new number is #{num}."
end

#=> The new number is 2.
#=> The new number is 4.

#=> [1, 2]



my_hash = { "one" => 1, "two" => 2 }

my_hash.each { |key, value| puts "#{key} is #{value}" }

one is 1
two is 2
#=> { "one" => 1, "two" => 2}

my_hash.each { |pair| puts "the pair is #{pair}" }

the pair is ["one", 1]
the pair is ["two", 2]
#=> { "one" => 1, "two" => 2}


# You may have noticed in the above code examples that #each returns the original array or hash regardless of what happens inside the code block. This is an important thing to keep in mind when debugging your code as it can lead to some confusion.

# Take this code as an example:
friends = ['Sharon', 'Leo', 'Leila', 'Brian', 'Arun']

friends.each { |friend| friend.upcase }

#=> ['Sharon', 'Leo', 'Leila', 'Brian', 'Arun']

# You might expect this to return ['SHARON', 'LEO', 'LEILA', 'BRIAN', 'ARUN'], but you’d be wrong—dead wrong. It actually returns the original array you called #each on. You’re still not invited, Brian.
